Test Proxy Usage Instructions
================================

Method 1: Use a query that returns your location/IP
----------------------------------------------------
Create a test job with this search query:
"what is my ip address"

If the results show your proxy's IP location (not your real location),
then the proxy is working correctly.


Method 2: Monitor with Network Tools
-------------------------------------
Windows: Use Resource Monitor or Wireshark
1. Open Resource Monitor (resmon.exe)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Run your scraper
4. Look for connections - you should ONLY see connections to your proxy server
   (p.webshare.io:80 in your case)
5. You should NOT see direct connections to google.com or googleapis.com


Method 3: Test with Blocked Proxy
----------------------------------
1. Set PROXY to an invalid address in .env:
   PROXY=http://invalid-proxy-test:9999

2. Run the application
3. It should FAIL to connect
4. If it succeeds, your real IP is being used (BAD!)


Method 4: Check Proxy Logs
---------------------------
If your proxy provider (webshare.io) provides logs:
1. Check their dashboard for request logs
2. Verify requests are coming through during your scraping
3. This confirms traffic is going through the proxy


Method 5: Use a Geo-Specific Test
----------------------------------
1. Set a proxy from a specific country (e.g., US proxy)
2. Search for "restaurants near me" with no location set
3. Results should be from the proxy's location, not yours
